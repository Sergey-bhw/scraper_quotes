This app is harvesting almost 600000 quotes with its author names.
To use it you need to have NodeJS installed and then run `npm install` in the terminal opened inside app directory. Make sure there is no errors during this.  
To use it just run `node scraper` in the terminal opened inside app directory, and you will see the progress.  
App stores the scraped data inside SQLite database every 2 minutes.  
For me it took about half an hour to scrape database ~200mb.
